#Slide Carousel 1975

So you've been on holiday for two weeks and have a thousand pictures ranging from what you had for breakfast to contents of the hotel room fridge but what to do with them?
Once upon a time your grandfather would have gathered the family into the front-room to sit through hours and hours of interminable slides. Sadly since the rise of the digital camera and smart phone those precious family moments have been lost to the past. Or have they? __Yes__.
But you __can__ emulate the experience with the Slide Carousel 1975 gallery toy thing. I haven't thought the title through obviously. 

Thanks to (http://www.freesound.org/people/soundslikewillem)[soundslikewillem] on FreeSound.org for the royalty free track: http://www.freesound.org/people/soundslikewillem/sounds/174785/ used in this monumental waste of effort and of course (https://github.com/robinnorth)[Robin] and Sarah for having 2 million f*****g photos from their honeymoon in New York. Congrats you douchebags.
